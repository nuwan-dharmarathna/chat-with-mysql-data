![Chatbot Screenshot](./chatbot.png)

## Overview

This project features a chatbot that leverages OpenAIâ€™s API and LangChain to interact with a MySQL database. Users can connect to a local database through a Streamlit dashboard and engage with the database using natural language queries. The chatbot also supports accessing and displaying `chat_history` for continuous and context-aware conversations.

## Features

- **Connect to Local MySQL Database**: Input database credentials in the Streamlit dashboard to establish a connection.
- **Natural Language Queries**: Use the chatbot to issue queries to the database in natural language.
- **Access Chat History**: The chatbot maintains and displays a history of interactions, allowing users to review previous queries and responses.
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Intuitive web interface for user interaction and database connection setup.
